    <h2 class="submenu">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredli">
      <li>4 (1 1/2 inches thick) boneless center-cut pork chops</li>

      <li>4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>

      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>

      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="submenu">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="stepsli">
      <li>
        Combine pork chops, Worcestershire, 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, and
        black pepper in a large, resealable plastic bag. Marinate chops in the
        mixture for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Remove pork
        from the marinade and place into the skillet to brown on all sides, 5 to
        7 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, basting with marinade during
        cooking, until no longer pink in the centers, 15 to 20 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145
        degrees F (63 degrees C).

      <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
